# pebble-simulator
The simulator for producing pebble data, write it to a local file and publish to AWS MQTT.

## Dependencies
- linux bash
- openssl 1.0.2g or later
- mosquitto-clients
- libcurl

## Run
`./simulator.sh`

```
========>> PEBBLE SIMULATOR <<========


 1.  Config Sensors

 2.  Set Number of Data Points (Current 30)

 3.  Generate Simulated Data

 4.  Publish to AWS MQTT

 5.  Publish to trypebble.io

 6.  Pebble blockchain

 7.  Exit

Select:
```
This, by default, produces 30 data points for all 8 sensors at random. The output is written to pebble.dat which looks like below.
```
{"message":{"SNR":187,"VBAT":4.36002,"gas_resistance":1173,"temperature":16.21609,"pressure":515.32678,"humidity":31.51630,"temperature":76.22284,"gyroscope":[6,-1214,8],"accelerometer":[937,1214,1491],"timestamp":"85000"},"signature_r":"00fb7f17b6f524a684ac392eb47761bd1f994fd0a1f92d227a263e3ea981d2007e02204","signature_s":""}
